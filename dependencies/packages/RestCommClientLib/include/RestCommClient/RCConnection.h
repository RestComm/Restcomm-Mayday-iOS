/**
 *  RCConnection represents a call. An RCConnection can be either incoming or outgoing. RCConnections are not created by themselves but
 *  as a result on an action on RCDevice. For example to initiate an outgoing connection you call [RCDevice connect:delegate:] which instantiates
 *  and returns a new RCConnection. On the other hand when an incoming connection arrives the RCDevice delegate is notified with 
 *  [RCDeviceDelegate device:didReceiveIncomingConnection:] and passes the new RCConnection object that is used by the delegate to
 *  control the connection.
 *
 *  When an incoming connection arrives through [RCDeviceDelegate device:didReceiveIncomingConnection:] it is considered RCConnectionStateConnecting until it is either
 *  accepted with [RCConnection accept] or rejected with [RCConnection reject]. Once the connection is accepted the RCConnection transitions to RCConnectionStateConnected
 *  state (TODO: the media part is only implemented for outgoing connections; for incoming connections only the signaling in in place for now -we are working on that)
 *
 *  When an outgoing connection is created with [RCDevice connect:delegate:] it starts with state RCConnectionStatePending. Once it starts ringing on the remote party it
 *  transitions to RCConnectionStateConnecting. When the remote party answers it, the RCConnection state transitions to RCConnectionStateConnected.
 *
 *  Once an RCConnection (either incoming or outgoing) is established (i.e. RCConnectionStateConnected) media can start flowing over it. DTMF digits can be sent over to 
 *  the remote party using [RCConnection sendDigits:] (TODO: Not implemented yet). When done with the RCConnection you can disconnect it with [RCConnection disconnect].

/**
 *  RCDevice Represents an abstraction of a communications device able to make and receive calls, send and receive messages etc. Remember that
 *  in order to be notified of RestComm Client events you need to set a delegate to RCDevice and implement the applicable methods.
 *  If you want to initiate a media connection towards another party you use [RCDevice connect:delegate:] which returns an RCConnection object representing
 *  the new outgoing connection. From then on you can act on the new connection by applying RCConnection methods on the handle you got from [RCDevice connect:delegate:].
 *  If thereâ€™s an incoming connection you will be notified by [RCDeviceDelegate device:didReceiveIncomingConnection:] delegate method. At that point you can use RCConnection methods to
 *  accept or reject the connection.
 *
 *  As far as instant messages are concerned you can send a message using [RCDevice sendMessage:to:] and you will be notified of an incoming message 
 *  via [RCDeviceDelegate device:didReceiveIncomingMessage:] delegate method.

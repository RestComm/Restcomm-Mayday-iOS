IMPORTANT: Domain is the sip domain to which the user has to register to. Agent is the agent name with whom the customer is going to have a call.  Since current code base doesn’t include any server side call queuing agent name is mentioned as part of the configuration so that when the May day icon is clicked he will be able to have a 1-2-1 call with the agent mentioned in the configuration. This agent configuration can be removed once the application uses server side call queueing.

= RestComm - MayDay iOS Application Deployment and Configuration

== Prerequisites
-	Restcomm Communications Platform
-	Xcode 6 and above with at least iOS SDK 7 or higher

== How to configure
-	Copy dependencies folder to project bundle.

-	 Rename ViewController.m to ViewController.mm to be able to use C++ code (which includes of some libs use)

-	 Add  libraries(libcrypto.a,libssl.a,libRestCommClient.a,libsofia-sip-ua.a ,libMayDay.a and   libWebRTC-9190) 
             to your project by choosing Choose File -> Add Files to “<Project     Name>”.
             *Note:* It resides inside dependencies->packages
             
-    Add MayDay images and xib's
             to your project by choosing Choose File -> Add Files to “<Project     Name>”.
             *Note:* It resides inside MayDay->MayDayImagesAndXIB

-  Include search paths in the Xcode. Go to project -> Select your target -> Build settings ->  Select ‘All’ to see all settings Search for ‘search’ to filter the Header Search Paths -> Edit the paths And then press the (+) sign to add the full paths to the includes for
*a. RestCommClient* library , *b. webrtc* and *c. mayday* library
As an example, in my case those full paths I added above are:

   $SOURCE_ROOT/../../dependencies/packages/RestCommClientLib/include/RestCommClient

   $SOURCE_ROOT/../../dependencies/packages/webrtc/include.

   $SOURCE_ROOT/../../dependencies/packages/mayday/include/MayDay.

-  Include search paths in the Xcode. Go to project -> Select your target -> Build settings ->  Select ‘All’ to see all settings Search for ‘search’ to filter the Library Search Paths -> Edit the paths And then press the (+) sign to add the full paths.
As an example, in my case those full paths I added above are: 

   $SOURCE_ROOT/../../dependencies/packages/openssl-1.0.1/lib/

   $SOURCE_ROOT/../../dependencies/packages/sofia-sip-1.12.11/lib/
 
   $SOURCE_ROOT/../../dependencies/packages/webrtc/

   $SOURCE_ROOT/../../dependencies/packages/RestCommClientLib

   $SOURCE_ROOT/../../dependencies/packages/mayday

-	 In Build Setting add *-Objc* flag to ‘Other Linker Flags

- Add needed frameworks and libs in the Xcode project by navigating from Build Settings to General. Your ‘Linked Frameworks and Libraries’ should look like this:

== How to Register and establish Video/Instant Messaging
 
===	Register

- Import RCManager.h 

- Set server URL and Agent name(Set Agent name when u want to establish call)

----
   [[RCManager sharedInstance].server URL=@”10.10.221.44”;
   [[RCManager sharedInstance].agent Name=@”bob”; 
----


- Call below method to register

----
   [[RCManager sharedInstance] registerWithUserName:username,password];
----

===	Video and instant Messaging

- Import RCManager.h 

- Import RCCustomChatAndVideoView.h

- Declare object of type RCCustomChatAndVideoView
RCCustomChatAndVideoView * mChatView;

- Call below method to establish video call

----
[[RCManager sharedInstance] connectToRC];
//Pass YES to the parameter if customer else NO for Agent
self.mChatView = [[RCManager sharedInstance]getRCCustomVideoChatView: CGRectMake(30,self.view.frame.size.height/2+100,Self.view.frame.size.width-60, self.view.frame.size.height/2-100)ToEmbedInClientVideoView:YES];
[self.view addSubview: self.mChatView];
----

- Call below method to establish Instant messaging

----
self.mChatView= [[RCManager sharedInstance] getRCCustomChatView: CGRectMake(0,   self.view.frame.size.height/2,self.view.frame.size.width,self.view.frame.size.height/2)]; 
[self.view addSubview: self.mChatView];
